# 1. Motivation
Home and Commercial projects often come to an end with surplus fasteners (Nuts, Bolts, Screws, etc..) in inventory. More often than not, particularly in a home enviroment, surplus fasteners are stored together in what becomes a large accumulation of assorted fasteners. It can be difficult to make use of these fasteners as they accumulate and become disorganised. The aim of this project is to provide the framework of a solution which can be coupled with mechanical actuation to automate the process of sorting fasteners by type and size.
